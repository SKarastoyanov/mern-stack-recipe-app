        This website was created by me, Stoil Karastoyanov, during a period when
        I was working as an aircraft mechanic, trying to change my career path
        and become an IT engineer. These are my first steps in programming and
        if there are any broken components or cosmetic remarks please excuse me.
        I hope you enjoy the content and find the website useful.
